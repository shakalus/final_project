Rick and Morty characters app

As my final project for the course i did an app inspired by the TV show Rick & Morty, the app shows the user an infinite scrollable list of characters from the show, and to get more information the user needs to tap on the character. Also the user can like their favourite characters, and pull to refresh the page.
